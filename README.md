# Logistic Regression

 The following project demonstrates fundamental concepts
 for better understanding logistic regression.

 # Description
 
 The following python notebook is an introduction to logistic regression fundamentals. It uses
 a data set consisting of heights, weghts, and genders of a number of people.  We are interested
 in classifying the data points by gender given the heights and weights of the people. To do this,
 we use techniques to determine a boundary between the two genders as you will see in the notebook.
 
 Of course, after creating the logistic regression model, we need to test the accuracy of it.  If we
 want to improve out model, we are interested in in creasing the probability that the classificiaton 
 of a test point is correct.  This process is called maximium likelihood estimation and it is demonstrated
 in this notebook.
